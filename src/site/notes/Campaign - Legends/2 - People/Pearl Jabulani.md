***Longevity***: It's unclear how long Pearl's lifespan really is.  She stopped physically aging in the 1890s.  She is exceptionally resilient against illness and disease, a fact she first discovered while treating patients during the Spanish Flu Epidemic of 1918.

***Rapid Regeneration***: Pearl can be injured normally, even by silver weapons, and experiences pain.  However, her wounds close rapidly, healing with no scarring in a matter of seconds.

***Sympathetic Shift Mastery***:  Ability to fully prevent another lycanthrope from shifting, even if they want to.  Pearl uses this power to absorb a pregnant Lycan's need to shift, even during the full moon, in order to protect the unborn child.
