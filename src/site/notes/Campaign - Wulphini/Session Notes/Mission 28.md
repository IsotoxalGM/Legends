# Final Phase of Solar Sabotage

We have one more opportunity to affect some real, physical sabotage to the comet capture mission, and that window is closing fast.  There's only a few short weeks left on the solar transit and the comet is passing through the worst of the solar heating phase.  Surface ops will be nearly entirely shut down during this phase due to the extent of the outgassing and surface fracturing.  We're still working out a way to approach the comet during this period without drawing attention.

In the meantime, however, there is a piece of equipment we need.  Time is too short to source one legitimately so we're going to have to steal it.  And by "we", we mean you.

### Solar Heating

The next few weeks of solar heating will add more thermal energy into the comet than its likely ever been subjected to in its history.  Thousands of the brightest minds were working this problem in the months preparing for cometary capture, and they think they have all the math and engineering worked out.  Our job is to make them second-guess there answers.  Our job is to panic the decision-makers enough into believing the engineers got something wrong.  Maybe enough panic to slow the mass driver operations down a little, and add one more notch of uncertainty to the overall capture plan.

To do this, we're going to create a deep pocket of essentially melt-water.  The device we want you to steal is a large thermal reactor designed to drill deep and melt an icy body from within, making extraction of water or other volatiles cheaper and easier on the collection teams.

If we can get this thermal drill installed somewhere on the north hemisphere of the comet, where the heating will be the worst, we might be able to melt a pocket big enough to create geological instabilities and fissures that scare the shit out of the brass.  We want them to think that if they continue mass drivers firing at full power, they could crack the comet in half.

That's step two though.  For now, we need you to go get that thermal drill.

### Thermal Drill

The teams at Brandmauer have narrowed down the search to two main targets.  One is way out in Saturn's rings.  We have a team headed out there now but that one is the Hail Mary.  It's distance means cutting the timeline way too close.

Your target is much closer.  It's right here in the main belt.  There's a Monolith Mining installation currently melting the core of the comet *Kresken*.  *Kresken* is just outside both Mars and Jupiter EgoNets, so no one will be able to download in time to rat you out before its too late. 

We need comet operations to believe the pocket of instability we create is from bad engineering, bad math, solar heating, and too much mass driver force.   The longer it takes for them to start wondering if its sabotage from a stolen thermal drill, the better.  This mean, of course, that what ever happens at the Monolith Mining station, word of it cannot get out.

#### Mining Outpost

The outpost is a crew of 12 to 14.  A small crew barge is parked against the surface of the comet.  Typically, the barge will be oriented with the bridge and comms room in the nose at the top of the stack, crew decks and medical in the middle, and a cargo hold at the bottom.  The cargo compartment usually connects to the top of the shaft leading to the subterranean drill station at the core.

Red Crew Barge, leads to Blue Access Shaft, leads to Purple Drill Station, creates Cyan Wet Pocket, venting through Green Vent Shaft, where its collected at Yellow Collection Tower.
